# AR-Furniture-Previewer
Made with Vuforia and Unity C#

A simple Andoid application that imposes 3-D models and objects over the input of the users phone camera. The user can choose between a bed, stool, or chair, and place them on the ground to simulate what it would look like if the piece of furniture was actually there.

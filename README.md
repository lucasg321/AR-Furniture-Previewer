# AR-Furniture-Previewer
Made with Vuforia and Unity C#

A simple Andoid application that imposes 3-D models and objects over the input of the users phone camera. The user can choose between a bed, stool, or chair, and place them on the ground plane to simulate what the object would look like if it were placed there in real life.
